In 2167, after survivability concerns were raised for in-service dropships, such as the UD-4, in low intensity and high intensity combat, a new dropship design was desperately needed. The UD-25 emerged after several failed survivability attempts in designing a new and unique craft to supplement current arsenal, though the end result was criticized for odd looks and even clunkier controls. According to data gathered, however, the UD-25 shown excellent survival probability in low intensity combat. Most of the engine power comes from two main CCTR-35 engines. The UD-25 is capable of flying with only one functional engine, though it will be unable to escape any gravity wells. Given its promising field testing and heightened survivability, another variant of the UD-25, the AUD-25, was later developed for close missile air support and transport duties.
