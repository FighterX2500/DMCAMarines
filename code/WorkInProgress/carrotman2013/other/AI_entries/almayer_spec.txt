- Westingland S-52 Fusion Reactor: A Type V linear fusion drive provides the main ship mode of movement when not in FTL travel.`\ Capable of generating 1.2 terawatt of engine power.`\
- Thiokol-Rockwell Dynamic Cygnus 7 hyperdrive tachyon shunt: A surprisingly efficient FTL engine capable of a dynamic power setting. Going from a lower power of traveling .75 light years per day to an afterburner of 1.3 light years per day. The USCM often uses a regular speed of 1 light year per day for patrol craft in order to avoid excessive fuel usage.
