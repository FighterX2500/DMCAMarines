The USS Almayer, an Arikara-class patrol transport, was christened in 2171 but designed in the 2150s during an increased need for patrol craft in deep space. The first Arikara-class patrol transports were constructed in the 2160s, and the USS Almayer was the 4th ship in the class produced. The USS Almayer was constructed in the Heinlein Memorial Shipyards located above the earthâ€™s moon for low gravity workstations. The main advantages of the Arikara patrol transport over other forms of transports and combat ships is its small footprint and rapid response time. However, the marines that serve aboard these patrol transports are either volunteer forces or conscripted to their long voyages in outer territories where most luxuries do not exist.`\

The USS Almayer underwent a Block 78A retrofit in 2178, which replaced many of the sensors and maintenance areas. Along with that, due to rising tensions between Weston Yamada and various outer rim colonies, pressured a need to include a corporate representative onboard. While the sum for this service was never officially disclosed, the USS Almayer was equipped with an office for a company representative and sent to patrol corporate outer-rim colonies.
